#Â README for Data Visualization and Linear Regression Analysis

<ins> Overview </ins> 

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook showcasing data visualization techniques and linear regression analysis using a dataset of London borough profiles. It involves generating insightful plots and performing linear regression using gradient descent.

<ins>Contents</ins>

Data visualization: Bar plots, pie charts, scatter plots, and seaborn plots.
Data partitioning: Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets.
Synthetic dataset generation.
Linear regression using gradient descent.
Evaluation of regression models using various metrics.

<ins>Installation</ins>
Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
sklearn
You can install these packages using pip or conda:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Run the Jupyter Notebook cell by cell to see each step of the analysis. The notebook is divided into sections, each focusing on different aspects of data visualization and linear regression.

<ins>Data Visualization</ins>
Visualize various aspects of the London borough profiles dataset, including population density, political landscape, age distribution, etc.

<ins>Partitioning the Data</ins>
Prepare the data for regression analysis by splitting it into training, validation, and test sets.

<ins>Generate Synthetic Dataset</ins>
Create a synthetic dataset to demonstrate linear regression.

<ins>Linear Regression on Data (I): Gradient Descent</ins>
Implement gradient descent to perform linear regression and predict life expectancy.

<ins>Visualization of Regression and Error Metrics</ins>
Plot the regression line and visualize error metrics over training epochs.
